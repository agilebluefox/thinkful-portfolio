                                challenge to design a simple application using the principles of the Model-View-Controller
                                (MVC) paradigm. The interactive features are entirely dependent on the JQuery library and
                                the code is primarily organized in three distinct files: controller.js, model.js, and view.js.
                                Easy, right? Although the concept seems simple, this application created some unexpected
                                challenges that forced me to focus intently on maintaining the separation of the components
                                into isolated blocks. On several occassions, I found myself unwittingly inserting code which
                                belonged in one division, such as the model, into functions residing in one of the other
                                areas, such as the controller. Overall, this project gave me a greater appreciation of the
                                importance of design patterns and the planning, discipline and commitment it takes to stay
                                on course, especially when a quick shortcut might resolve a mind-bending issue in the short
                                run.

                                more efficient css code. Webpack provided the final bundling of the javascript files that
                                were used in the "production" version of the application.</p>

                                application built using the Angular framework. The user can add an event or select an already
                                existing event to manage, view, or track participants as their status changes during the
                                event. All data changes are saved to the associated Mongo collections through API calls to
                                the routes on the Node server setup using Express. This project presented numerous challenges
                                beginning with the database design to managing the state of the application using Observables,
                                the foundation of reactive programming. Although manipulating and passing data through Angular
                                parent and child components is relatively simple, I ran into issues when data was altered
                                in components with no direct connection. As a result, I had the opportunity to solve problems
                                dealing with the concepts of application state, object immutability, and the asynchronous
                                nature of the web browser.

                                and since our university relies heavily on Google Apps I intend to use it frequently in future
                                applications. To implement the forms in the application I chose Angular's Reactive Forms
                                technology which allowed me to keep most of the form logic in the component and maintain
                                a cleaner, more maintainable template file.

                                Some changes in our IT hosting regulations on campus prevented the use of server-side scripting
                                languages, such as PHP, forcing me to rethink the design of my on-campus portfolio. To prevent
                                repetitive code and avoid spreading the content throughout pages of HTML, I utilized an HTML
                                template which gets populated by a combination of a JSON datafile and a few JQuery functions.
                                However, the challenge doesn't end here. Since the information on the site requires frequent
                                updating I implemented a build system using Gulp JS to quickly compile and publish changes
                                as needed. Using LESS, I designed the CSS layout from scratch successfully creating a responsive
                                design which allows my students using mobile devices to easily access the site and find the
                                content relevant to their needs.

                                additional javascript libraries. To add a little flare and to make the project more fun and
                                interesting, I included an AJAX-rendered news feed using the Health section of the New York

                        to using well-designed mobile and web applications in their daily lives and activities. The same

                        Technology, Engineering, and Math) university, I feel it's important to make an effort to maintain
                        pace with the latest technologies, especially those that are clearly going to make an impact in the
                        near future.</p>

                    <p>This objective is not without it's challenges. Modern web design technologies are changing very quickly
                        leading to a constant debate regarding what types of systems to adopt and how to implement software
                        that is cost-effective, easily maintained and upgradable when major and minor improvements become
                        available. An additional concern in the realm of higher education is the control and protection of
                        data belonging to the university, it's faculty and staff, and the students. </p>
                    <h6 class="about-section">Why Angular?</h6>
                    <p>I've chosen to concentrate my efforts in taking advantage of the proliferation of the
                        Javascript programming language, a built-in feature of the modern web browser. Additionally, the
                        Angular framework supported by Google fits well with my goals, expectations, and requirements. As
                        a full-stack framework built upon the principles of reactive programming and reinforced by the strengths
                        of Typescript, I believe that Angular applications offer the benefit of stable development support
                        while providing a reasonable balance of quick development, managable upgradability, and relative
                        longevity.
