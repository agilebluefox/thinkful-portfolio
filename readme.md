# Introduction

This portfolio provides a brief overview of my skills, experience and interests in web development and application design.

## Setup

To optimize the images, use `gulp images`. Run `gulp serve` to compile the html, css, and javascript assets to the build directory and start up browserSync to view the site locally during development. When the site is ready to publish use `gulp deploy` to upload the site to Surge.sh to view a live, hosted version of the site.
